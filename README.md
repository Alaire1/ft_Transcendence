## Architecture

### Backend (Django)
- Handles user management (registration, authentication)  
- WebSocket support (e.g., Django Channels) for real-time gameplay and chat  
- REST endpoints for user profile, game data, etc.

### Frontend (Vanilla JS SPA)
- Single-page application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Connects via WebSockets for live game events and chat  
- Interfaces with Django‚Äôs REST API for authentication and game lifecycle

### Docker & Orchestration
- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` included‚Äîfor backend, frontend, and Nginx  
- Separate services allow containerized development and seamless deployment
